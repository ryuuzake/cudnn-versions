# cuDNN-versions

We've all been there. You're setting up a custom installation of Jax/Torch/TensorFlow and... Agh! The `cuDNN` version you installed doesn't match what your framework supports! You hastily install a new cuDNN distribution and now you have missmatch with your `CUDA` toolkit, and a pretty big mess. `cuDNN-versions` aims to ease some of this strain. This repository provides a `scoop` bucket containing every `cuDNN` build, for every applicable `CUDA` version, so that you can easily search and install what you're looking for.

## Usage

This repo can be added like any other scoop bucket by running the following command.

```
scoop bucket add cudnn-versions https://github.com/ryuuzake/cudnn-versions
```

You should be able to search for `cuDNN` distributions with `scoop search`.

```
‚ùØ scoop search cuDNNv9

## Version Triples

Every `cuDNN` build is index by a target tripple that looks like `<CUDNN_VERSION>-<CUDA_VERSION>-<PLATFORM>`.

| Field         | Description                                | Example     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| CUDNN_VERSION | The version of the cuDNN library           | cuDNNv8.4.1 |
| CUDA_VERSION  | The compatible CUDA toolkit version        | CUDAv11.6   |
| PLATFORM      | The platform the distribution is built for | windows10   |

## Contributing

Manifests in this bucket are created automatically by the `discover-versions.ps1` script in the root of this repository. Any changes that you want to see should be made to that file.
